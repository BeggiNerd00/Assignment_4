Done:

1. Write a program to find the sum of all elements of the Listusing a loop.


2. Using the list above, write a program that prints out only the numbers that are largeror equal to 20, and smaller or equal to 80. Finally print out how many numbers metthe condition.

3. Write a program that asks the user for a number (stdin.readLineSync()), over andover again, forever, until he stops giving a number (just presses enter). Store everynumber in a List. At the end of the program, print out the largest and the smallestvalue the user entered.

4. Write a program that asks the user for a string (stdin.readLineSync()), over and overagain, forever, until he stops giving a string (just presses enter). Store every entry in aList. At the end of the program, print out the contents of the list in a reversed order.
